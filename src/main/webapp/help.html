        If this option is checked, Jenkins makes it possible to set an environment
        for the Job by defining environment variables and execute a script (a setup script).<br/>
        All these actions will be executed before a SCM checkout.<br/>
        After the set up, only injected variables (with Jenkins variables) will be available in the build scripts, in
        the Jenkins post-actions, and so on. <br/>
        Default inherited environment variables (inherited variables by the Jenkins process which often contains
        machine-specific information, like PATH, TIMEZONE, etc.) will not be available.
