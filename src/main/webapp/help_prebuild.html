        If this option is checked, Jenkins makes it possible to set an environment
        for the build job (or for each run on a matrix project) by executing a script
        (a setup script).<br/>
        These actions will be executed in a JobProperty "prebuild" phase, after a SCM checkout but before the build-proper starts.
        This allows, for example, to setup build environment for Maven project based on SCM data, which would otherwise be impossible,
        since Maven project requires Maven to be available even before any of the build wrappers are executed.<br/>
