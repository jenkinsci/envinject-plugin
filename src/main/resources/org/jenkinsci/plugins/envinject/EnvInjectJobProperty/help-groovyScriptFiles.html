        Evaluate Groovy script files and inject the
        key value pairs returned in their result maps into the environment variable pool.<br/>
        Enter a comma/space separated list of paths, possibly including variable macros.
        Example: ${path_to_script_foo}, ${path_to_script_bar}, path_relative_to_hudson_home_on_the_node_or_master/script.groovy, /absolute_path_on_the_node_or_the_master/script.groovy<br/>
        Paths may be relative to the Hudson home directory or be absolute paths, and are
        evaluated on the node or on the master depending on the "Load script and properties files from the master"
        option.<br/>
        The Groovy scripts must return a Java map object.<br/>
        You can access parameters and other environment variables through variables in the Groovy script.<br/>
        This is especially useful to trigger Groovy scripts set by the SharedObjects plugin.<br/> 
        Note: the scripts are expected to be UTF-8 encoded.
