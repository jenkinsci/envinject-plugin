        By setting this to true, an environment variable 'BUILD_CAUSE' holding all causes of the running build is
        populated (separated by ',').

    <ul>
        <li>BUILD_CAUSE = SCMTRIGGER,TIMERTRIGGER,MANUALTRIGGER,UPSTREAMTRIGGER</li>
    </ul>


    In addition each single trigger gets available as single environment variable:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>BUILD_CAUSE_SCMTRIGGER = true (SCM Trigger)</li>
        <li>BUILD_CAUSE_TIMERTRIGGER = true (Triggered by Schedule)</li>
        <li>BUILD_CAUSE_MANUALTRIGGER = true (triggered by user)</li>
        <li>BUILD_CAUSE_UPSTREAMTRIGGER = true (triggered by upstream project)</li>
    </ul>

    ...unknown triggers will be added with its implementation name in upper case.<br/>
    ...unknown triggers/causes (e.g. from plugins other than from core) will be added with its implementation name in
    upper case.
