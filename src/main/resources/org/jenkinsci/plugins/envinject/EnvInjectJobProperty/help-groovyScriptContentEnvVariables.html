        Evaluate the Groovy scripts that the the given environment variables contain and inject the
        key value pairs returned in their result maps into the environment variable pool.<br/>
        Enter a comma/space separated list of environment variable names. Example: variable_name_of_script_foo, variable_name_of_script_bar<br/>
        The Groovy scripts must return a Java map object.<br/>
        You can access parameters and other environment variables through variables in the Groovy script.<br/>
        This is especially useful to trigger Groovy scripts set by the SharedObjects plugin. <strong>Note:</strong>
        <i>Populate Shared Objects</i> must be enabled to access variables contributed by that plugin.
