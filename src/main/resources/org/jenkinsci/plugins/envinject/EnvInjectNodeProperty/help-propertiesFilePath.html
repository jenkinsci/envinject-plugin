    Specifies location of a property file with additional variables to be injected.

  <p>
    If you specify a relative path, then Jenkins will firstly try to resolve this path
    against the HOME directory of the user executing the agent process.
    If it fails to find a file there, then it will try resolution against the
    working directory of the agent.
    This behavior is a subject to change
    (see <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-23666">JENKINS-23666</a>).

    <b>Warning!</b> The variables specified by this file are being cached and refreshed
    only on node connection.
    If you modify this entry or the file contents for a Jenkins agent,
    you will need to reconnect this agent to the controller in order to apply the changes.
    If you modify settings for the controller, you will have to restart the controller.
