    Specifies location of a property file with additional variables to be injected.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you specify a relative path, then Jenkins will firstly try to resolve this path
    against the HOME directory of the slave/master user.
    If it fails to find a file there, then it will try resolution against the 
    working directory of the node/slave.
    This behavior is a subject to change 
    (see <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23666">JENKINS-23666</a>).

  <p>
    <b>Warning!</b> The variables specified by this file are being cached and refreshed
    only on node connection.
    If you modify this entry or the file contents for a Jenkins slave/agent, 
    will need to reconnect this slave/agent to the master in order to get
    changes applied.
    If you modify settings for the Master node, you will have to restart the master.
