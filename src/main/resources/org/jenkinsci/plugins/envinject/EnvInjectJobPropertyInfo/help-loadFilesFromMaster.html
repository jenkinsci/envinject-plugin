        If enabled, load files (properties or scripts) from the master node.
        Without check this option, Jenkins loads the files from the target node (slave/agent or master).
        Loading the files from the master may enable you to avoid conflicts between to have a generic
        path, such as the problematic between Windows and Linux when your job is not attached to a specific node.
        Anyway, the file will be processed from the target node.

        As of EnvInject 2.0, global configuration can disable this option.
        When the option has been disabled by global configuration, you will see a warning in order to flag that the option was configured by the job but is now disabled.
        Once the option has been turned off - to acknowledge the job has been reconfigured - the option will disappear from the UI.

    <p>
        It is <b>not recommended</b> to use this option in new jobs even if it is enabled.
