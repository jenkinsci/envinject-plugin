        If enabled, load files (properties or scripts) from controller.
        Without this option, Jenkins loads the files from the target node (agent or controller).
        Loading the files from the controller may avoid conflicts between environment variables,
        such as the problematic <code>PATH</code> variable used on both Windows and Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of EnvInject 2.0, global configuration can disable this option.
        When the option has been disabled by global configuration, you will see a warning in order to flag that the option was configured by the job but is now disabled.
        Once the option has been turned off - to acknowledge the job has been reconfigured - the option will disappear from the UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is <b>not recommended</b> to use this option in new jobs even if it is enabled.
