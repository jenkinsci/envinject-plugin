        Load files (properties or scripts) from the master node. <br/>
        Without check this option, Jenkins loads the files from the target node (slave or master). <br/>
        Loading the files from the master may enable you to avoid conflicts between to have a generic
        path, such as the problematic between Windows and Linux when your job is not attached to a specific node. <br/>
        Anyway, the file will be processed from the target node.
