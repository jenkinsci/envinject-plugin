    If enabled, users will be able to use the "Load script and properties files from the master" option in job configurations.
    It was a default behavior in EnvInject versions before 2.0, but it has been disabled due to the security reasons.
    It is <b>not recommended</b> to enable this option on new installations.

  <p>
    If common Jenkins users are allowed to run jobs on the master,
    this option <b>is not enough</b> to protect files on the master instance.
    Job runs may be access these files by loading of local files in the EnvInject configuration
    or just by executing a Shell/Batch build step.
    The only way to protect your instance from such threat is to disable the job execution
    on the master node.
    It can be done via plugins like <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-restrictions">Job Restrictions Plugin</a>.
