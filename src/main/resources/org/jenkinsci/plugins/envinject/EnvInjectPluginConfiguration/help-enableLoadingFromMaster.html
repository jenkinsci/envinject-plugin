    If enabled, users will be able to use the "Load script and properties files from the controller" option in job configurations.
    It was the default behavior in EnvInject versions before 2.0, but it has been disabled due to security reasons.
    It is <b>not recommended</b> to enable this option on new installations.

    <b>Warning: </b>If common Jenkins users are allowed to run jobs on the controller,
    this option <b>is not enough</b> to protect files on the controller instance.
    Job runs may be access these files by loading of local files in the EnvInject configuration
    or just by executing a Shell/Batch build step.
    The only way to protect your instance from such threat is to disable the job execution on the controller node.
    It can be done via plugins like <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-restrictions">Job Restrictions Plugin</a>.
    Also see <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-24513">JENKINS-24513</a>, which tracks the improvement proposal in the core.
