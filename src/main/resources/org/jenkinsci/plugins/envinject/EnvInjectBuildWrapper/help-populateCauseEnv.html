        By setting this to true, an environment variable 'BUILD_CAUSE' holding all causes of the running build is populated (separated by ',').
        In addition each single trigger gets available as single environment variable:<br />
        <ul>
        	<li>BUILD_CAUSE = SCMTRIGGER,TIMERTRIGGER,MANUALTRIGGER,UPSTREAMTRIGGER</li><br /> 
        	<li>BUILD_CAUSE_SCMTRIGGER = true  (SCM Trigger)</li>
        	<li>BUILD_CAUSE_TIMERTRIGGER = true (Triggered by Schedule)</li>
        	<li>BUILD_CAUSE_MANUALTRIGGER = true (triggered by user)</li>
        	<li>BUILD_CAUSE_UPSTREAMTRIGGER = true (triggered by upstream project)</li>
        </ul>
        ...unknown triggers/causes (e.g. from plugins other then from core) will be added with its implementation name in upper case. The easiest to find its real name is to print out BUILD_CAUSE once.
