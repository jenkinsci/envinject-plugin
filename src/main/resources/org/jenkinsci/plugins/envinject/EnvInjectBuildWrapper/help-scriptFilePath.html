        Execute a script file aimed at setting an environment such a create folders, copying files, and so on.<br/>
        Give the script file path. <br/>
        The file path can be absolute path or relative to the workspace (the process is executed before a SCM checkout).<br/>
        You can use the above properties variables. <br/>
        However, adding or overriding environment variables in the script has no impact in the build job.
